**Large-scale ecological restoration is not only an environmental challenge—it is, above all, a deeply human process.**

At Nideport, every forest restoration project is built together with the communities that have inhabited and cared for the territory for generations, integrating scientific knowledge, technology, and ancestral wisdom.

In the **Atlantic Forest**, one of the most biodiverse and threatened ecosystems on the planet, Nideport works directly and consistently with local and Indigenous communities, particularly with **35 Mbya Guaraní communities**. This relationship goes beyond the implementation of an environmental project; it is grounded in collaboration, mutual respect, and shared learning.

### **Technology and Ancestral Knowledge: A Complementary Approach**

While Nideport contributes environmental monitoring technologies—such as **artificial intelligence, autonomous drones, IoT sensors, live cameras, photogrammetry, and the georeferencing of each planted tree**—communities contribute deep knowledge of the territory, forest cycles, biodiversity, and natural balances that are not always captured by formal science.

This exchange enables the design of **more effective restoration strategies**, adapted to the local context and guided by a long-term perspective. The forest is not understood through data alone; it is also understood through lived experience, daily observation, and collective memory.

**Restoration Is Also Learning**

### **Environmental Education and Community-Based Work**

As part of its integrated approach, Nideport promotes **environmental education programs** in collaboration with rural schools and communities neighboring the project areas. These initiatives include participatory workshops, on-the-ground educational activities, and intergenerational dialogue spaces where children, youth, and adults reflect on forest stewardship, climate change, and the importance of biodiversity conservation.

In addition, **specific training programs** are developed in forest fire prevention, responsible land management, and safety protocols—strengthening local capacities and fostering a shared culture of territorial care.

### **Long-Term Social Impact**

Nideport’s community-based work also translates into **tangible social impacts**: local job creation, strengthening of community economies, improvements in basic infrastructure, and support for sustainable productive initiatives. These pillars are part of an integrated development strategy that seeks to ensure environmental restoration goes hand in hand with human well-being.

Within the **Selva Paranaense Vida Nativa Project**, certified under the international **Verra VCS and CCB Gold** standards, community impact is a core pillar of the model. Forest restoration is not conceived as an extractive process, but as a collective endeavor with a forward-looking vision.

### **Restoring the Future, Together**

For Nideport, regenerating ecosystems means recognizing that there are **no lasting climate solutions without empowered communities**. The combination of technology, science, and local knowledge makes it possible to advance toward restoration models that are more just, effective, and sustainable.

In the context of a global climate crisis, working hand in hand with communities demonstrates that it is possible to protect nature while creating opportunities, preserving culture, and building a shared future.
