Together with them, we carry out activities that strengthen relationships and deepen understanding of their culture and social organization, respecting their protocols for intercommunity relations and their relationship with the forest. We have implemented a public consultation with rural communities and a Free, Prior and Informed Consent (FPIC) process with the Indigenous community, aiming to establish a consensual and long-term collaboration, safeguard their rights, and co-design support programs for climate change adaptation and for improving their living conditions within the framework of their own worldview and relationship with nature.",

Satellites, drones, IoT, monitoring cameras, and biotechnology are integrated into an artificial intelligence-powered platform that detects anomalies, generates verifiable automated alerts, and ensures full traceability of every intervention. This enables us to make precise decisions, reduce risks, and streamline MRV—accelerating native forest restoration and supporting ultra-high-quality carbon credits.",
